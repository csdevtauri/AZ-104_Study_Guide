Are you ready to see the answers and explanations for each question?

Here are the answers and explanations for each question:

#### Question 1
What happens to the existing web apps in a resource group if you decide to deploy a third one?

- [ ] A. The existing web apps will be automatically deleted. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. The existing web apps will remain unchanged. (Correct)
- [ ] C. The existing web apps will be updated. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. You cannot deploy more than two web apps in a resource group. (Incorrect)

Explanation: Deploying a new web app in a resource group does not affect the existing web apps. They will remain unchanged.

#### Question 2
Which statement is true about resource groups in Azure?

- [ ] A. A resource can belong to multiple resource groups simultaneously. (Incorrect)
- [ ] B. A resource group can be renamed after its creation. (Incorrect)
- [x] C. A resource group can contain resources of different types and regions. (Correct)
- [ ] D. Resources in a resource group must all be in the same region. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A resource group can contain resources of different types and regions. However, a resource can belong to only one resource group, and a resource group cannot be renamed after its creation.

#### Question 3
What is a key factor to consider when defining a resource group?

- [ ] A. Resources can be moved freely between resource groups without any limitations. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. All resources in the group must share the same lifecycle. (Correct)
- [ ] C. A resource group must contain resources of only one type (e.g., only virtual machines). (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. Resource groups are primarily used for grouping resources in development environments, but not in production. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A key factor when defining a resource group is to ensure that all resources within the group share the same lifecycle. This means they should be created, updated, and deleted together.

#### Question 4
Why does a resource group require a location?

- [ ] A. To determine the billing region for the resources. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. To indicate where to store the metadata about the resources. (Correct)
- [ ] C. To restrict resource creation to a specific region. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. The location of the resource group is not important and can be selected randomly. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A resource group requires a location to indicate where to store the metadata about the resources. The location does not necessarily restrict the creation of resources to that specific region.

#### Question 5
What is the best practice concerning interactions between resources from different resource groups?

- [ ] A. Resources from different resource groups cannot interact with each other. (Incorrect)
- [ ] B. Resources should interact only if they share the same type and region. (Incorrect)
- [x] C. Interactions are common and acceptable, especially if the resources are related but do not share the same lifecycle. (Correct)
- [ ] D. It is recommended to place all interconnected resources in the same resource group for easier management. (Incorrect)

Explanation: Interactions between resources from different resource groups are common and acceptable, especially if the resources are related but do not share the same lifecycle. It is not necessary to place all interconnected resources in the same resource group for easier management.
