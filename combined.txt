- [ ] A. The existing web apps will be automatically deleted. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. The existing web apps will remain unchanged. (Correct)
- [ ] C. The existing web apps will be updated. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. You cannot deploy more than two web apps in a resource group. (Incorrect)

Explanation: Deploying a new web app in a resource group does not affect the existing web apps. They will remain unchanged.

#### Question 2
Which statement is true about resource groups in Azure?

- [ ] A. A resource can belong to multiple resource groups simultaneously. (Incorrect)
- [ ] B. A resource group can be renamed after its creation. (Incorrect)
- [x] C. A resource group can contain resources of different types and regions. (Correct)
- [ ] D. Resources in a resource group must all be in the same region. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A resource group can contain resources of different types and regions. However, a resource can belong to only one resource group, and a resource group cannot be renamed after its creation.

#### Question 3
What is a key factor to consider when defining a resource group?

- [ ] A. Resources can be moved freely between resource groups without any limitations. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. All resources in the group must share the same lifecycle. (Correct)
- [ ] C. A resource group must contain resources of only one type (e.g., only virtual machines). (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. Resource groups are primarily used for grouping resources in development environments, but not in production. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A key factor when defining a resource group is to ensure that all resources within the group share the same lifecycle. This means they should be created, updated, and deleted together.

#### Question 4
Why does a resource group require a location?

- [ ] A. To determine the billing region for the resources. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. To indicate where to store the metadata about the resources. (Correct)
- [ ] C. To restrict resource creation to a specific region. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. The location of the resource group is not important and can be selected randomly. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A resource group requires a location to indicate where to store the metadata about the resources. The location does not necessarily restrict the creation of resources to that specific region.

#### Question 5
What is the best practice concerning interactions between resources from different resource groups?

- [ ] A. Resources from different resource groups cannot interact with each other. (Incorrect)
- [ ] B. Resources should interact only if they share the same type and region. (Incorrect)

- [ ] A. To increase the speed of resource deployment. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. To prevent accidental deletion of resources. (Correct)
- [ ] C. To automate resource creation. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. To reduce resource management costs. (Incorrect)

Explanation: Resource Manager locks in Azure are primarily used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of resources. They do not affect the speed of resource deployment, automate resource creation, or reduce resource management costs.

#### Question_2
Where can a Resource_Manager lock be associated?

- [ ] A. Only to an individual resource. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. To a subscription, a resource group, or a specific resource. (Correct)
- [ ] C. Only to an Azure subscription. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. Only to an Azure Resource Manager template. (Incorrect)

Explanation: A Resource Manager lock can be associated with a subscription, a resource group, or a specific resource. It is not limited to individual resources, Azure subscriptions, or Azure Resource Manager templates.

#### Question_3
What happens with locks when they are applied to a resource group?

- [ ] A. Child resources do not inherit locks. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. Child resources automatically inherit locks. (Correct)
- [ ] C. Locks must be manually applied to each child resource. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. Locks are reset each time a new resource is added to the group. (Incorrect)

Explanation: When locks are applied to a resource group, child resources automatically inherit those locks. They do not need to be manually applied to each child resource, and they are not reset when new resources are added to the group.

#### Question_4
What are the two types of resource locks available in Azure_Resource_Manager?

- [ ] A. Update locks and creation locks. (Incorrect)
- [ ] B. Read-only locks and delete locks. (Incorrect)
- [x] C. CanNotDelete and ReadOnly locks. (Correct)
- [ ] D. Permanent locks and temporary locks. (Incorrect)

Explanation: The two types of resource locks available in Azure Resource Manager are CanNotDelete and ReadOnly locks. CanNotDelete locks prevent deletion of the resource, while ReadOnly locks prevent deletion, modification, and creation (write operations) but allow read operations.

#### Question_5
Who is authorized to create or delete management locks in Azure?

- [ ] A. Any user with read access to the resource. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. Only the User Access Administrator and Owner roles. (Correct)
- [ ] C. Only the Azure Active Directory global administrator. (Incorrect)
- [ ] D. All members of the organization with an Azure account. (Incorrect)

Explanation: Only the User Access Administrator and Owner roles are authorized to create or delete management locks in Azure. This requires specific permissions, and not all users, such as those with only read access or all members of the organization with an Azure account, have these permissions. The Azure Active Directory global administrator does not have these permissions by default.

- [ ] A. Validate JSON templates before deployment. (Incorrect)
- [x] B. Provide resources that you can deploy and manage via Resource Manager. (Correct)
- [ ] C. Organize resources into logical groups to simplify management. (Incorrect)
